### Introduction

Python is a versatile, high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Its extensive standard library and active community contribute to its widespread adoption and continuous development.
