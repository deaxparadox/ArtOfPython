# Web Development in Python

A lot frameworks and libraries are available to do web development, being a python developer it'd reduced a lot of work for me. Imagine the there were no frameworks or libraries for web development, one need to learn a new programming language from scratch along with the set of libraries or a framework to learn development. So, here is details list libraries and frameworks for web development using Python:



- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/): The most Popular fullstack framework.
- [DjangoRestFramework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/): REST API framework for Django.

- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/): Minimalist configuration to fullstack solution.
- [Sanic](https://sanic.dev/en/): Used for API development, similar to FastAPI.
