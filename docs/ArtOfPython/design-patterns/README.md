# Design patterns in Python

Design patterns are proven solutions to commonly occuring problems in software design. They provide a reusable template to solve specific issues and can help developers avoid common pitfalls and improve the maintainability of their code.

Following are the design patterns in python:

- [Singleton Pattern](/code/design-patterns/singleton-patterns.py): Ensures that only one instance of the class is created and provides a global point to access to that instance.
- [Factory pattern](/code/design-patterns/factory-patterns.py): Provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
- [Abstract factory](/code/design-patterns/abstract-factory.py)
- [Prototype](/code/design-patterns/prototype.py)
- [Builder](/code/design-patterns/builder-pattern.py)
- [Adapter pattern](/code/design-patterns/adapter-patterns.py): Allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.
- [Decorator pattern](/code/design-patterns/decorator-patterns.py): Allows behavior to be added to an individual object, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.
- [Facade pattern](/code/design-patterns/facade-patterns.py): Provides a similified interface to a larger body of code, such as a class library.
- [Proxy pattern](/code/design-patterns/proxy-pattern.py)
- [Composite pattern](/code/design-patterns/composite-pattern.py)
- [Bridge pattern](/code/design-patterns/bridge-pattern.py)
- [Chain of responsibility](/code/design-patterns/chain-of-responsibility.py)
- [Command pattern](/code/design-patterns/command-patterns.py): Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different request, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.
- [Observer pattern](/code/design-patterns/observer-patterns.py): Allows objects to be notified when a change occurs in another object.
- [Mediator pattern](/code/design-patterns/mediator-pattern.py)
- [Template method pattern](/code/design-patterns/template-method-patterns.py): Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a superclass but lets subclass override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.
- [Strategy pattern](/code/design-patterns/strategy-patterns.py): Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable at runtime.
- [State pattern](/code/design-patterns/state-pattern.py)
- [Memento pattern](/code/design-patterns/memento-pattern.py)
- [Visitor pattern](/code/design-patterns/visitor-pattern.py)



Each design is implemented in a separate Python file, which includes a brief description of the pattern, its purpose, and an example of how it can be used in practice.
