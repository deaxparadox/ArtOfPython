# Design patterns in Python

Design patterns are proven solutions to commonly occuring problems in software design. They provide a reusable template to solve specific issues and can help developers avoid common pitfalls and improve the maintainability of their code.

Following are the design patterns in python:

- [Singleton Pattern](/code/design-patterns/singleton-patterns.py): Ensures that only one instance of the class is created and provides a global point to access to that instance.
- [Factory pattern](https://): Provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
