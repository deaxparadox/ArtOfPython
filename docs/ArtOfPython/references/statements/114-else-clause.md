# else Clause

The `else` clause is used to match alternate condition or control the flow of the program, if the given set of condition in the program didn't matches. Here is the simple example of `if-else` clause.

In the following example, if the `a` is set to `1`, the we will desired ouptut, else we will get another output.

```py
In [4]: a = 1

In [5]: if a == 1:
   ...:     print("A is 1")
   ...: else:
   ...:     print("Another world")
   ...: 
A is 1

In [8]: a = 2

In [9]: if a == 1:
   ...:     print("A is 1")
   ...: else:
   ...:     print("Another world")
   ...: 
Another world
```

This is the simple example of `if-else` clause, but, you can also apply the `else` clause to [for](102-for/for.md#for-else-usage), [while](103-while/while.md#else-clauses), `try`.
