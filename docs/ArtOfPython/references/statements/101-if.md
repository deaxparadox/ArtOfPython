# if, if..else, Nested if, if-elif Statments

There comes situations in real life when we need to do some specific task and based on some specific conditions and, we decide what should we do next. 

Similarly there comes a situation in programming where a specific task is to be performed if a specific condition is `True`. In such cases, conditional statements can be used. 


# Comparing condition

Before moving forward, let me explain you how condition work. 

Whenever you compare condition it always return the `bool` type:

```py
>>> 1 == 2
>>> False

>>> 1 == 1
>>> True
```

```py
'debian' == "ubuntu"
False 
```

```py
a = True

>>> a is True
>>> True

>>> a
>>> True

>>> a == True
>>> True

>>> a == False
>>> False
```

As you have seen all the comparism operation alway return `bool` type.


The following are  the conditional statements provided by Python:

# if Statement

Simple Example:

```py
if 10 > 5:
    print("10 greather than 5")
```

output :

```opt
10 greather than 5
```

example2:

```py
a = 10
b = 5
if a > b:
    print("a is creator than b")

print("Exiting...")
```

```output
a is creator than b
Exiting...
```


# if..else Statement

In conditional if Statement the additional block of code is merged as else statement which is performed when if condition is false.

Syntax:

```py
if (condition):
    # Executes this block if 
    # condition is true
else:
    # Executes this block if 
    # condition is false
```

example_1:

```py
a = 10
b =  15
if a > b:
    print("a is greator than b")
else:
    print("a is less than b")
    
print("Exiting...")
```

```output
a is less than b
Exiting...
```

example_2:

```py
a = True

if a:
    print("a is True")
else:
    print("a is False")

print("Exiting...")
```

```output
a is True
Exiting...
```

example_3:

```py
a = False

if a is False:
    print("a is False")
else:
    print("a is True")

print("Exiting...")
```

```output
a is False
Exiting...
```


example_4:

```py
a = "linux"

if a == "linux":
    print("My OS is Linux.")
else:
    print("My OS is unkonwn.")

print("Exiting")
```

```output
My OS is Linux.
Exiting
```

# Nested if or if-else Statements

`if` or `if-else` statement can be nested inside one-another:

Syntax:

```py
if (condition1):
    # if condition is True
    # then,
    if (condition2):
        # if condition2 is True
        # Execute block
    else:
        # if condition2 is false
        # execute this block
else:
    # if condition1 is false 
    # execute this block
    if (condition3):
        # if condition3 is True
        # Execute block
    else:
        # if condition3 is false
        # execute this block
```


example_1:

```py
a = 5
b = 10

if a == 5:
    if b == 10:
        print('a and b are divisible of 5')
else:
    print('a and b are not divisible of 5')
    
```

```output
a and b are divisible of 5
```

example_2: This example is similar to previous, but in this case we combine nested if statement in single if:

```py
a = 5
b = 10

if a == 5 and b == 10:
        print('a and b are divisible of 5')
else:
    print('a and b are not divisible of 5')
```

```output
a and b are divisible of 5
```


# if-elif-else Statements

Syntax:

```py
if (condition1):
    # if condition1 is True
    # Execute this block
elif (condition2):
    # if condition2 is True
    # Execute this block
else:
    # all condition is False
    # then, execute this block
```

example_1:

```py
letter = "A"
 
if letter == "B":
    print("letter is B")
 
elif letter == "C":
    print("letter is C")
 
elif letter == "A":
    print("letter is A")
 
else:
    print("letter isn't A, B or C")
```

```output
letter is A
```

You can remove `else`, it's not compulsary. You can also next `if-elif-else` statements.

## Conditional returns (or inline if-else)

**if-else** can also be used when we used in `return`, `comprehensions`.

### return

```py
>>> def f1(x):
...     return 0 if x < 5 else 10
... 
>>> f1(3)
0
>>> f1(13)
10
>>> f1(5)
10
>>> 
```

- It's equivalent using `if-else` block is:

```py
>>> def f1(x):
...     if x < 5:
...             return 0
...     else:
...             return 10
... 
>>> f1(3)
0
>>> f1(13)
10
>>> f1(5)
10
>>> 
```
