There comes situations in real life when we need to do some specific task and based on some specific conditions and, we decide what should we do next. 

Similarly, there are situations in programming where a specific task need to be performed if, a specific condition is `True` or `False`. In such cases, conditional statements can be used. 


### Expression

Before moving forward, let me explain you how condition work. Whenever you compare condition it always return the `bool` type:

```py
>>> 1 == 2
>>> False

>>> 1 == 1
>>> True
```

```py
>>> 'debian' == "ubuntu"
>>> False 
```

```py
>>> a = True
>>> 
>>> a is True
>>> True
>>> 
>>> a
>>> True
>>> 
>>> a == True
>>> True
>>> 
>>> a == False
>>> False
```

As you have seen all the comparison operation alway return `bool` type. Let's go through the usages of **if-elif-else** statement, one-by-one. Starting with **if** statement.

### The `if` statement

This is simplest statement for testing a condition. Consider the following case, here we are testing decimals `10 > 5`, 

```py
if 10 > 5:
    print("10 greather than 5")
```

output :

```opt
10 greather than 5
```

example2:

```py
a = 10
b = 5
if a > b:
    print("a is creator than b")

print("Exiting...")
```

```output
a is creator than b
Exiting...
```


### The if..else statement

In conditional if Statement the additional block of code is merged as else statement which is performed when if condition is false.

Syntax:

```py
if (condition):
    # Executes this block if 
    # condition is true
else:
    # Executes this block if 
    # condition is false
```

Example: 

```py
a = 10
b =  15
if a > b:
    print("a is greator than b")
else:
    print("a is less than b")
    
print("Exiting...")
```

```output
a is less than b
Exiting...
```

example_2:

```py
a = True

if a:
    print("a is True")
else:
    print("a is False")

print("Exiting...")
```

```output
a is True
Exiting...
```

example_3:

```py
a = False

if a is False:
    print("a is False")
else:
    print("a is True")

print("Exiting...")
```

```output
a is False
Exiting...
```


example_4:

```py
a = "linux"

if a == "linux":
    print("My OS is Linux.")
else:
    print("My OS is unkonwn.")

print("Exiting")
```

```output
My OS is Linux.
Exiting
```

### Nested `if` or `if-else` Statements

`if` or `if-else` statement can be nested inside one-another:

Syntax:

```py
if (condition1):
    # if condition is True
    # then,
    if (condition2):
        # if condition2 is True
        # Execute block
    else:
        # if condition2 is false
        # execute this block
else:
    # if condition1 is false 
    # execute this block
    if (condition3):
        # if condition3 is True
        # Execute block
    else:
        # if condition3 is false
        # execute this block
```


Example of nest **if** statement.

```py
a = 5
b = 10

if a == 5:
    if b == 10:
        print('a and b are divisible of 5')
else:
    print('a and b are not divisible of 5')
    
```

```output
a and b are divisible of 5
```

example_2: This example is similar to previous, but in this case we combine nested if statement in single if:

```py
a = 5
b = 10

if a == 5 and b == 10:
        print('a and b are divisible of 5')
else:
    print('a and b are not divisible of 5')
```

```output
a and b are divisible of 5
```


### The `if-elif-else` statements

The **if-elif-else** conditional statement is used to test multiple condition in a single satement block. Starting with **if** block testing the initial, then based on the if testing, **elif** condition(s) are tested, and lastly the **else** block in executed if all the above condition fails.

Syntax:

```py
if (condition1):
    # if condition1 is True
    # Execute this block
elif (condition2):
    # if condition2 is True
    # Execute this block
else:
    # all condition is False
    # then, execute this block
```

example_1:

```py
letter = "A"
 
if letter == "B":
    print("letter is B")
 
elif letter == "C":
    print("letter is C")
 
elif letter == "A":
    print("letter is A")
 
else:
    print("letter isn't A, B or C")
```

```output
letter is A
```

You can remove `else`, it's not compulsary. You can also next `if-elif-else` statements.

### Conditional returns (inline `if-else`)

The **if-else** can also be used when we used in `return`, `comprehensions`. First, we are going see the conditional returns using *if-else* statement.


```py
>>> def f1(x):
...     return 0 if x < 5 else 10
... 
>>> f1(3)
0
>>> f1(13)
10
>>> f1(5)
10
>>> 
```

- It's equivalent using `if-else` block is:

```py
>>> def f1(x):
...     if x < 5:
...             return 0
...     else:
...             return 10
... 
>>> f1(3)
0
>>> f1(13)
10
>>> f1(5)
10
>>> 
```
