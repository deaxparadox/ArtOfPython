# `dict` types

Dictionary are `key-value` pair data structure.

-  with the requirement that the keys are unique (within one dictionary).

- dictionaries are indexed by keys, which can be any immutable type; strings and numbers can always be keys. 
- Tuples can be used as keys if they contain only strings, numbers, or tuples.
- If a tuple contains any mutable object either directly or indirectly, it cannot be used as a key.
