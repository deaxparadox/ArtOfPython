# Anonymous Functions: lambda

Python also provides an expression from that generates functions objects. It's called **lambda**. Like **def**, this expression creates a function to be called later, but it returns the function instead of assigning it to a name. This is why **lambdas** are known as *anonymous* functions.

## lambda Basics

Syntax:

```
lambda argument1, argument2, ...argumentN: expression using arguments
```

- **lambda** is an expression, not a statement.
- **lambda**'s body is a single expression, not a block of statements.
