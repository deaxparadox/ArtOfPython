# Sets

A set is an unordered collection with no duplicate elements. 

- Basic uses include membership testing and eliminating duplicate entries. 
- Set objects also support mathematical operations like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference.

- Curly braces or the `set()` function can be used to create sets.
