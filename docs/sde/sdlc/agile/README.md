##### 1. Requirement Gathering

- In this stage, the project team identifies and documents the needs and expectations of various stageholders, including clients, users, and subject matter experts.
- It involves defining the project's scope, objective and requirements.
- Establising a budget and schedule.
- Creating a project plan and allocating resources.


##### 2. Design

- Developing a high-level system architecture.
- Creating detailed specifications, which include data structures, algorithms and interfaces.
- Planning for the software's user interface.

##### 3. Development (Coding)

Writing the acutal code for the software. Conducting unit testing to verify the functionality of individual components.


##### 4. Testing

This phase involves several types of testing:

- Integration testing: Ensuring that different components work together.
- System testing: Testing the entire system as a whole.
- User acceptance testing: Confirming that the software meeds user requirements.
- Performance testing: Assessing the system's speed, scalability and stability.

##### 5. Deployment

- Deploying the software to a production environment.
- Put the software into the real world where people can use it.
- Make sure it works smoothly in the real world.
- Providing training and support for end-users.

##### 6. Review (Maintenance)
