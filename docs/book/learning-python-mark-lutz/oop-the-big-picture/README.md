# OOP: The Big Picture

*class*--a coding structure and device used to implement new kinds of objects in Python that support inheritence. Classes are Python's main object-oriented programming (OOP) tool. OOP offers a different and often more effective way of programming, in which we factor code to minimize redundancy, and write new programs by *customizing* existing code instead of changing it in place.

Classes are created with statement: The **class**.
