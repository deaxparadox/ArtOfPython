    "\n",
    "`__getattr__` and `__getattribute__` for method-name attributes implicitly fetch by built-in operations, these methods may *not be run at all*. This means that operator overloading calls cannot be delegated to wrapped objects unless wrapper classes somehow redefine these methods themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, attribute fetchs for the `__str__`, `__add__`, and `__getitem__` methods run implicitly by printing, + expressions, and indexing, respectively,are not routed to the generic attribute interception methods in 3.X. Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In Python 3.X, *neither*, `__getattr__` nor `__getattribute__` is run for such attributes.\n",
    "- In Python 2.X classic classes, `__getattr__` *is* run for such attributes if they are undefined in the class.\n",
    "- In Python 2.X, `__getattribute__` is available for new-style classes only and works as it does in 3.X."
