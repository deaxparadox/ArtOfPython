    "# `__getattr__` and `__getattribute__`\n",
    "\n",
    "Properties and descriptors are used for managing specific attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `__getattr__` and `__getattribute__` operator overloading methods provide still other ways to intercept attribute fetches for class intances. Like properties and descriptors, they allow us to insert code to be run automatically when attributes are accessed. These two methods cal also be used in more general ways. Because they intercept arbitary names, they apply in broader roles such as delegation, but may also inur extra calls in some contexts, and are too dynamic to register in `dir` results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Attribute fetch interception comes in two flavors, coded with two different methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `__getattr__` is run for *undefined* attributes--because it is run only for attributes not stored on an instance or inherited from on of its classes, its use is straightforward.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `__getattribute__` is run for *every* attribute--because it is all-inclusive, you must be cautious when using this method to avoid recursive loops by passing attribute accesses to a superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "These two methods are representatives of a set of attribute intercpetion methods that also includes `__setattr__` and `__delattr__`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike properties and descriptors, thse methods are part of Python's general *operator overloading* protocol--specially named methods of a class, inherited by subclasses, and run automatically when instances are used in the implied built-in operation. Like all normal methods of a class, they each recevie a first **self** argument when called, giving access to any required instance state information as well as other methods of the class in which they appear.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `__getattr__` and `__getattribute__` methods are also more generic than properties and descriptors--they can be used to intercept access to any (or even all) instance attribute fetches, not just a single specific name. Because of this, these two methods are well suited to general *delegation*-based coding patterns--they can be used to implement wrapper (a.k.a. proxy) object that manage all attribute accesses for any embedded object. By contrast, we must define one property or descriptor for every  attribute we wich to intercept.\n",
    "\n",
    "These two methods are more *narrowly focused* then the alternatives we considered earlier: they intercept attribute fetches only, not assignments. To also catch attribute changes by assignment, we must code a `__setattr__` methods--an operator overloading method run for every attribute fetch, which must take care to avoid recursive loops by routing attribute assignments through the instance namespace dicitionary os a superclass method. We can also code a `__delattr__` overloading method (which must avoid loop in the same way) to intercept attribute deletions. By constrast, properties and descriptors catch get, set and delete operations by design."

    "\n",
    "If a class defines or inherits the following methods, they will be run automatically when an instance is used in the context described by the commas to the right:\n",
    "\n",
    "```pr \n",
    "def __getattr__(self, name):        # On undefined attribute fetch [obj.name]\n",
    "def __getattribute__(self, name):   # On all attribute fetch [obj.name]\n",
    "def __setattr__(self, name, value): # On all attribute assignment [obj.name=value]\n",
    "def __delattr__(self, name):        # On all attribute deletion [del obj.name]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In all of these, **self** is the subject instance as usual, **name** is the string name of the attribute being accessed, and **value** is the object being assigned to the attribute. The two get methods normally return an attribute's value, and other two return nothing (None). All can raise exceptions to signal prohibited access.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to catch every attribute fetch, we can use either of the first two previous methods, and to catch every attribute assignment we can use the third. The following uses `__getattr__` and workds on both Python 2.X and 3.X, not requiring new-style **object** in 2.X:"
