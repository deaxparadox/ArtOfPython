# Text

Python can manipulate text (represented by type `str`, so called "strings") as well as numbers.

String are sequence of character, it can be created using single quotes:

```python
>>> 'span eggs'         # single quotes
'span eggs'
>>> 
```

Double quotes can also be used to create string:

```python
>>> "span eggs"         # double quotes
'span eggs'
>>> 
```

Digits and numerals enclosed in quotes are also strings:

```python
>>> "1975"      # digits and numerals enclosed in quotes are also strings
'1975'
```
