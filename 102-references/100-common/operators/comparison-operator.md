# Comparisons Operator

There are eight compairson operations in Python. They all have the same priority (which is higher than that of the Boolean operations).

- `<`: strictly less than, `__lt__()`

```python
>>> 1 < 2
True
```

- `<=`: less than or equal, `__le__()`

```python
>>> 1 <= 2
True
>>> 2 <= 2
True
```

- `>`: strictly greater than, `__gt__()`

```python
>>> 2 > 1
True
>>>
``` 

- `>=`: greater than or equal, `__ge__()`

```python
>>> 2 > 1
True
>>> 2 >= 2
True
>>> 
```

- `==`: equal, `__eq__()`

```python
>>> 1 == 1
True
>>> 2 == 1
False
```

- `!=`: not equal

```python
>>> 1 != 2
True
>>> 2 != 2
False
```
