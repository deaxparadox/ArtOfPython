# Classes

Classes provide a means of building data and functionality together.

- Creating a new class creates a new *type* of object, allowing new *instances* of that type to be made.
- Each class instance can have attributes attached to it maintaining its state.
- Class instances can also have methods (defined by its class) for modifying its state.

## A Word About Names and Objects

Objects have individuality, and multiple names (in multiple scopes) can be bound to the same object.
- This is known as aliasing in other languages.
