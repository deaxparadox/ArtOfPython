# Repetition

Python list also support support repetition, but we can on repeat list of list, which mean we can only repeat next list only:

```py>>> [[]] * 3
[[], [], []]
```

- if we try this single list nothing happen:

```py
>>> [] * 2
[]
>>> [] * 3
[]
```

All the repeat list are just reference of first (or simply each other), so if we try to added value to any of the nested list, each one will be same because they are reference of each other.


```py
>>> a[0].append(1)
>>> a
[[1], [1], [1]]
>>>
>>> a[2].append(3)
>>> a
[[1, 3], [1, 3], [1, 3]]
>>> 
```
